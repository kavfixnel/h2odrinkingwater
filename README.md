# www.h2odrinkingwater.com

This is the GitHub pages page for the site backing [www.h2odrinkingwater.com](https://www.h2odrinkingwater.com/)

The reason this site exists is because the original owner of the website has abandoned it, but left a reference
to it on a bunch of water bottles in Thailand. I decided to investiagte the traffic to this domain.

## Technology

Since this was mostly just a joke project, the requirements were pretty basic:

- Low cost
- Simple to maintain
- But still basic metrics

I decided to go with a basic DNS entry with the provider of my choice (Namecheap) and host the site with [GitHub Pages](https://github.io/). For metrics, I decided to try out [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/). It's EU hosted, privacy and GDPR preserving, has a free 30 day trial and is very easy to set up.
